### Project Name: Exploring Skims' Best-Selling Products
***
### Project Objective
##### What problem are you solving?
Skims currently has over 50 various products on their best sellers tab on their webpage. While this shows that these products sell particularly better than others, it is unclear exactly why this is the case. To better understand this, I will be analyzing all 52 best selling products and dive deeper as to what makes these products popular as well as find patterns amongst the products. This will allow various stakeholders to have a stronger understanding on their products and make strategic decisions based on the insights.
##### How are you solving this problem?
I will be solving this problem by collecting all relevant data found on the best sellers page. I will first web scrape all product names, prices, average ratings from customers (out of 5 stars), and the total reviews it has received. As I do not have access to any invoice information, I will be using the count of reviews in replace of the order count. I will look for trends and patterns within the products on the best sellers page and analyze why certain products are more popular than others.

  name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
