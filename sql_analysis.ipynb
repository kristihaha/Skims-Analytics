    "Insight:  The results show the total average price of all products per category. Out of the seven categories, Cotton has the lowest total average price, followed by Soft Smoothing, Fits Everybody, Boyfriend, Soft Lounge, Sculpting, and Swim. Fits Everybody has the most reviews (orders) and high customer ratings out of all categories which explained its popularity. We wanted to see if the price was the main factor as to why it was popular, however, it is the third cheapest overall category. This proves that customers genuinely like this category for other reasons simply than just the price. Swim was the least popular category when it came to total reviews and also is the most expensive category which may be due to how much higher the average product costs are compared to other cateogories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recommendation: While it may be risky, raising the price of the Fits Everybody products may help the company to generate more revenue from this category. We saw that this line is a customer favorite and not because of the price. Customers most likely will continue to purchase their favorites from this collection even if the price increases. Also, Skims should consider lowering the average price of the Swim products to see if it will generate more sales. Customers most likely are not purchasing the swim products due to the high price. "
